# B Tree

B trees implementation written in C based on Introduction to Algorithms, CLRS.

### Prerequisites

* gcc (Ubuntu 5.4.1-8ubuntu1) or higher
* clang version 4.0.0-1ubuntu1 or higher

### Installing

First compile the project on your local system by:

```
make clean
make
```
For testing if it works, see Running tests below

## Running Tests

For manual tests, run:

``` 
./test [OPTIONS]... [PARAMETERS]...

OPTIONS:
	
    -b [LENGTH]
        Build B tree and flush to file bearing [LENGTH] records from dataset.csv
    -s [KEY]
        Print record details bearing the given [KEY] by reading existing file.
    -sb [LENGTH] [KEY]
        Build B tree and flush to file bearing [LENGTH] records from dataset.csv and print record details bearing the given [KEY]
    -t [LENGTH] 
        Testing option.
    
EXAMPLE:
    ./test -t 100000 75643
```

To clear existing .dat file:

```
make remdat

```

## Deployment

For using the B Tree:

* Copy BTree.h and Node.h header files to the location of your source file.
* Include BTree.h and Node.h to your source file.
* Use BTree.o and Node.o object files and compile your program:
