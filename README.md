# B Tree

B trees implementation written in C based on Introduction to Algorithms, CLRS.

### Prerequisites

* g++ version 6.3.0 or higher
* clang++ version 4.0.0-1ubuntu1 or higher

### Installing

First compile the project on your local system by:

```
make clean
make
```
For testing if it works, see Running tests below

## Running Tests

For manual tests, run:

``` 
./test [OPTIONS]... [PARAMETERS]...

OPTIONS:

        Print record details bearing the given key.
    -t [LENGTH] 
        Testing option.
    
EXAMPLE:
	./test -t 100000 75643
```

To clear existing .dat file:

```
make remdat

```

## Deployment

For using the Suffix Tree:

* Copy SuffixTree.h and Node.h header files to the location of your source file.
* Include SuffixTree.h and Node.h to your source file.
* Use SuffixTree.o and Node.o object files and compile your program:
 
Alternative (recommended):

```
make clean
make slib
```

Copy the libsuffix.a from lib folder and use it as static library.
